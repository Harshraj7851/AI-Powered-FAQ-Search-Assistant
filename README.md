🧠 AI-Powered FAQ Search Assistant
A smart, NLP-driven assistant that uses semantic search to match user questions with relevant FAQ answers. Built using LangChain, HuggingFace models, and FAISS for fast and accurate retrieval.

🔍 Features
Semantic search using transformer-based embeddings
Fast and scalable similarity search using FAISS
Query processing and response generation with LangChain
Easily extendable for custom FAQ datasets or domain-specific applications

⚙️ How It Works
Preprocess your FAQ data (questions + answers)
Convert FAQ questions into vector embeddings using HuggingFace models
Index those vectors using FAISS
When a user asks a question:
The input is embedded into vector space
FAISS searches for the most similar FAQ(s)
The matched answer is returned (or enhanced via LangChain logic)
